        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm <strong>Shane</strong>, a <strong>21-year-old</strong> 
          <strong> BSIT student</strong> at <strong>Western Mindanao State University</strong>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I love <strong>bonding with people who respect and value relationships</strong>, and I 
          truly enjoy being accompanied by those I feel comfortable with. I grew up 
          with my <strong>lola</strong>, surrounded by <strong>family and friends</strong> who taught me the 
          importance of <strong>kindness, resilience, and hard work</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for <strong>technology and creativity</strong> led me to pursue a career in 
          <strong> Software Development</strong>. I find joy (but right now not yet hehe) in <strong>solving problems, 
          designing user-friendly interfaces, and creating seamless digital experiences</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academics, I love exploring new skills to expand my knowledge and 
          stay up to date with industry trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, youâ€™ll find me either hanging around, or simply 
          enjoying deep conversations with people who inspire me. I believe that 
        growth happens through connections, experiences, and a continuous pursuit of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to become a <strong>Senior Developer</strong>, contributing to <strong>innovative and 
          impactful projects</strong> while constantly learning and improving.
